# Digit_Recognizer
## A Basic Handwritten Digit Recognizer using Convolutional Neural Networks

This little project uses Tensorflow backend and is trained on the MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset. If you don't have the required Anaconda environment ready, you can just install Tensorflow via pip (assuming you have Python 3.5+)

```$ pip install tensorflow ```

You can download the training and testing dataset as well:

```$ mkdir data
$ curl https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv -o data/mnist_train.csv
$ curl https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_test.csv -o data/mnist_test.csv
```

You should be good to go!
